Hello and welcome to this perhaps adequate model!

Here's what you need to do:
1. Clone this repo
2. Set up a new conda environment using environment.yml. Here's the command for the command line: 
conda env create -f environment.yml
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open test_notebook.ipynb
4. Run all cells in test_notebook.ipynb to use our model and get the final score
5. If you want to see how the training went, open the train_notebook. If you want to see how the cleaning went, open the clean_notebook. 
6. Have a nice day and keep it real!

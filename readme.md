## Rossman Kaggle Mini-Competition

Hello and welcome to this perhaps adequate model!

Here's what you need to do:
1. Clone this repo
2. Set up a new conda environment using environment.yml
3. Run all cells in test_notebook.ipynb to use our model and get the final score
4. If you want to see how the training went, open the train_notebook. If you want to see how the cleaning went, open the clean_notebook. 
5. Have a nice day and keep it real!

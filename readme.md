## Rossman Mini-Competition

This is the winning solution from a Mini-Competition at Data Science Retreat in Berlin. The goal is to predict future sales in Rossman stores across Europe. The data - originally from a Kaggle challenge - has been manipulated using the data.py file (introducing NaNs etc) to increase the difficulty. 

The competition was held with limited time and the notebooks are left in their original state as they were at the competition's submission deadline. 

The solution was awarded first place for an achieved RMSPE of 18.8%.

Instructions:
1. Clone this repo
2. Set up a new conda environment using environment.yml: 
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Activate the conda environment you just created:
`conda activate minicomp`
4. There are 3 notebooks which loosely resemble the workflow. In notebook 3 you can train our model and test it to get the final score. In the others you can follow our data cleaning and exploration process.

## Rossman Mini-Competition

This is the 1st place solution from a Mini-Competition at Data Science Retreat in Berlin. The goal is to predict future sales in Rossman stores across Europe. The data - originally from a Kaggle challenge - has been manipulated using the data.py file (introducing NaNs etc) to increase the difficulty. 

Instructions:
1. Clone this repo
2. Set up a new conda environment using environment.yml. Here's the command for the command line: 
conda env create -f environment.yml
3. Activate the conda environment you just created:
conda activate minicomp
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open test_notebook.ipynb
5. Run all cells in test_notebook.ipynb to use our model and get the final score
6. If you want to see how the training went, open the train_notebook. If you want to see how the cleaning went, open the clean_notebook.
